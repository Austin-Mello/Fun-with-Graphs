# DESCRIPTION
-------------
 * This program takes uses stdin to read the lines of an inputted .txt file.
 * The corresponding inputs are used to create a list of node classes, as well 
   an adjacency matrix filled with weighted edge classes in their correct 
   positions.
 * Using the Bellman-Ford algorithm (along with some additional simple 
   comparisons) this program finds uses stdout to output the longest path from
   the Node 1 to Node N, as well as finds the number of distinct paths from 
   Node 1 to Node N.


# TIME COMPLEXITY
----------------- 
 * All functions and algorithms are implemented in O(N^2) time or better in 
   accordance with the assignment rubric for an adjacency matrices.

# NOTES
-------
 * It is the hope of the author that this incredibly fancy README will earn him
   the extra credit necessary to offset the 5% late penalty.  Thank you for 
   your consideration, you magnificent person.  You deserve a raise or something.
